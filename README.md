This repository houses the Node.js RESTful API supporting Parkour: A social media site designed for hikers! More information about the concept and functionality of the site is available in the frontend repository, [parkour-frontend](https://github.com/oj713/parkour-frontend/). 

## Technical Implementation

This API was build using Node.js. Data is housed in a MongoDB Atlas database and is accessed using the Mongoose package. The API supports CRUD operations for User and Post data, such as registering a new user, deleting a post, updating a profile, etc. It also supports user login and authentication.
